# wikipedia-game

The goal of the [Wikipedia Game] is to find the least amount of clicks to get from one wikipedia page to another (without leaving wikipedia).

This command line Python script uses a breadth-first approach. The target url by default has been set to the Python wiki page.

Note you need to install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`:

**requests:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Possible Improvements
* Using multiple threads
* Improve algorithm with backtracking
