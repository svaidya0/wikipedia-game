# wikipedia-game

The goal of the [Wikipedia Game] is to find the least amount of clicks to get from one wikipedia page to another (without leaving wikipedia).

This command line Python script uses a breadth-first approach. The target url by default has been set to the Python wiki page.

Note you need to the following dependencies if you don't already have them:

**requests:**
```
pip install requests
```

**BeautifulSoup 4:**
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
